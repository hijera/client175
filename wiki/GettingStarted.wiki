#summary Instructions for downloading and running Client175
==Introduction==
This is intended to be run on the same server as mpd and will default to connecting to localhost:6600.  It will, however, use the MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT environment variables if they exist.  Tag editing will only work if the files are accessible and writable by the user running the server and the music_directory option is set correctly in site.conf.


==Requirements==
A running MPD daemon (at least version 14.0) and python 2.6 are all that you need.


==Installation and Setup==
No releases are available yet, but the current version in the repository is stable.  To get started:

  * Checkout the source from svn:  {{{svn checkout http://client175.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ client175}}}
  * CD into the new directory:  {{{cd client175}}}
  * Edit the music_directory option in *site.conf* to point to your music directory, this is required to edit tags.
  * Start the server:  {{{python server.py}}}
  * Open a web browser to http://localhost:8080/static/index.html
