#summary Instructions for downloading and running Client175
==Introduction==
This is intended to be run on the same server as mpd and will default to connecting to localhost:6600.  It will, however, use the MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT environment variables if they exist.  Tag editing will only work if the files are accessible and writable by the user running the server and the music_directory option is set correctly in site.conf.


==Requirements==
A running MPD daemon (at least version 14.0) and python 2.6 are all that you need.


==Installation and Setup==

===Install from SVN (recomended)===

  * Checkout the source from svn:  {{{svn checkout http://client175.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ client175}}}
  * CD into the new directory:  {{{cd client175}}}
  * Edit the music_directory option in *site.conf* to point to your music directory, this is required to edit tags.
  * Start the server:  {{{python server.py}}}
  * Open a web browser to http://localhost:8080/static/index.html

===Install Packaged Release===
  * Download and extract the latest package from the Downloads section.
  * Edit site.conf
  * Open a terminal, cd into the directory you extracted to, and run the server:  {{{python server.py}}}
  * Open a web browser to http://localhost:8080/static/index.html


===Run on Startup: Upstart conf file===

Here is an example provided by chrissavery for starting the server when mpd starts on systems using Upstart (such as ubuntu.)  You should use the run_as option in site.conf to drop down to a restricted user (also provided by chrissavery.)

client175.conf:
{{{# init file for client175 

start on started mpd
stop on stopping mpd

exec /usr/bin/python /opt/client175/server.py
}}}
